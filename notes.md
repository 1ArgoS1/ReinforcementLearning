 run for more iterations in case of initialisation. eg - ucb1 , softmax, mea . 
 eg - if runs less than len(arms) then run initialisation else run normal mode.
 
 clean the history function in bandit and generate plotting data.

 highly explorative behavoir to get bounds on values of N arms. Binary choice. 
 apply rl to solving x*x*x cube optimally. 
 Optimisation algorithms - gradient , RL ,
